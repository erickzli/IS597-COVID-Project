    "## Data Notes\n",
    "This data came from the Carnegie Mellon Delphi Epidata API (covidcast). The data source is SafeGraph. Here is the link to more information about the SafeGraph data: https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/safegraph.html. \n",
    "I attempted to pull this data myself, but covidcast wasn't installing on the laptop I was running it on (since my normal laptop was being repaired at the time). Since I couldn't get it to install and time was a little tight, Erick ran my code (the code below) on his laptop and then transfered the collected datasets to my GitHub folder.\n",
    "The data that I now have from this is the following: the fraction of mobile devices that did not leave the area of their home on a 7-day trailing window average (com_home_week.csv), the fraction of mobile devices that spent more than 6 hours at a location other than home during the daytime (most likely a full time job) of a 7-day trailing window average (full_time_week.csv), and the fraction of dvices that spent between 3 and 6 hours at a location other than home during the daytime (most likely a part time job) on a 7-day trailing window average (part_time_week.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "More documentation on this data can be found at https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/safegraph-inactive.html and https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/social-distancing-metrics."
